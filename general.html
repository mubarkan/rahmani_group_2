          <p><strong>Our History &amp; Heritage</strong></p>
          <p>The Rahmani Group was formed in 2005. Rising from humble beginnings in the transportation industry in 2002, the company's owner was inspired by the role that his business could play in changing the way business is done in Afghanistan. Over the last decade, the firm expanded and diversified to form the unique international group that the Rahmani Group is today. With more than 3000 employees active across the companies the group is invested in, today we have established a reputation as a global leader within a diverse range of businesses; including logistics and transportation, energy solutions, real estate and manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Now, almost a decade later, we are on a path to pursue our dream; revolutionizing the corporate industry in Afghanistan. Over the years, we have come a long way and have grown in capacity, performance, and image building.</p>
          <p>Today, the country knows us as it's first and largest cement manufacturer, innovating within the industry. In the face of growing competition, we have focused upon non-traditional management techniques to help secure our place. As a company, we are committed to the growth and sustainability of the corporate sector in the Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>With respect to new business investments, we are focusing on industrial development. Within a few years, we will be producing cement and steel. Further vertical integration is under consideration.</p>
          <p>In all of our businesses, we are determined to remain sensitive to market needs, maintaining agile and flexible business structures. Furthermore, our activities in corporate social responsibility are designed to support the growth and development of various sectors of the Afghani economy.</p>
          <p>We are also venturing into consumer markets by producing poultry, for both wholesale and retail customers. Pharmaceutical product manufacturing is also on tap as we seek to provide better quality medicine for the Afghani market.</p>
          <p>We have the largest supply chain network across the country with linked offices in neighboring countries as well. This gives us one of the most competent and complex transportation networks in the region.</p>
